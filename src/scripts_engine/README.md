# scripts

In some cases, it's very usefull write simple scripts for different kinds of detections, and to not force
a single scripting language, it's better to have the possibility to run multiple kind of scripts.

Any interpreter should implement the `Interpreter` interface from `interpreter.h` to be very easy to add new
interpreters.
